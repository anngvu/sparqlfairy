However, I can give you some examples based on the ontology you've provided. Here are a few:\n\nQuestion: What datasets are part of the 'Omics theme'?\nQuery: \n`\nSELECT ?dataset WHERE {\n  ?dataset a :Dataset .\n  ?dataset :Theme :Omics .\n}\n`\n\nQuestion: What are the various annotations available for nPOD datasets?\nQuery:\n`\nSELECT ?annotation WHERE {\n  ?dataset a :nPOD_Dataset .\n  ?dataset :Annotation ?annotation .\n}\n`\n\nQuestion: How many T1D donors are there in the database?\nQuery: \n`\nSELECT (COUNT(?donor) AS ?numDonors) WHERE {\n  ?donor a :T1D_Donor .\n}\n`\n\nQuestion: Retrieve age of donors with Caucasian race?\nQuery: \n`\nSELECT ?donor ?age WHERE {\n  ?donor a :nPOD_Donor .\n  ?donor :Race :Caucasian .\n  ?donor :donorAge ?age .\n}\n`\n\nQuestion: What is the sex distribution among the nPOD donors?\nQuery: \n`\nSELECT ?sex (COUNT(?donor) AS ?numDonors) WHERE {\n  ?donor a :nPOD_Donor .\n  ?donor :Sex ?sex .\n} GROUP BY ?sex\n`\n\nThese are just a few examples.
