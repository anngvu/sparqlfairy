Other questions could cover different aspects such as molecular functions, cellular components, genetic data, protein data, donor sex, race, autoimmunity, and much more, all depending on the actual data in the knowledge graph. Many more natural language questions and their corresponding SPARQL queries can be generated based on the available data and the ontological structure provided."}, :finish_reason "stop"}], :usage {:prompt_tokens 6951, :completion_tokens 582, :total_tokens 7533}}
